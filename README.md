# TextMate HelvectorLight Theme

This is a tweaked version of the Twilight with a couple more scopes to cover the [ActionScript 3 Bundles][as3_repo] Syntax. All is explained in [this post](http://blog.simongregory.com/12/helvectorlight-theme/), and you're only likely to need it to clear up ugly looking ASDoc blocks.

# Installation

Via download:

 * Open this [link][bundle_zip]
 * Unzip the download
 * Rename the folder to ActionScript 3.tmbundle
 * Double-click
 * TextMate handles the rest!

To install via Git:

	cd ~/"Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/"
	git clone git://github.com/simongregory/helvectorlight-tmbundle.git HelvectorLight.tmbundle

Source can be viewed and forked via [GitHub][repo_master]
